# IMPORTANT NOTE
I'm still in the middle of adapting this code over from PSMoveService. It's in a very broken state at the moment. Don't bother to try and sync and build this yet.

# PSVRTracker
A sample application that demonstrate optical position and orientation tracking of the PSVR headset as well as sensor fusion with the accelerometer and gyro.

# Prebuilt Releases
You can download prebuilt releases (Windows only at the moment) from the [Releases](https://github.com/HipsterSloth/PSVRTracker/releases) page. Then follow the initial setup instructions found in the [wiki](https://github.com/HipsterSloth/PSVRTracker/wiki#initial-setup). 

# Building from source
If you want to make modifications to the service or want to debug it, you can build the project from source by following the  [Building-from-source](https://github.com/cboulay/PSMoveService/wiki/Building-from-source) instructions. Currently supported build platforms are Win10 and OS X with Linux support hopefully coming in the near future.
